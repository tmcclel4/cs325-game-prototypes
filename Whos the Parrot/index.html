<h2>Who's the Parrot?</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Figure out which curtain the parrot is behind by asking questions!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme of this game is family member reincarnated as a parrot. 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should experience an easy going puzzle game that requires a little thinking.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player gets 10 questions to choose from, and over the course of the game chooses 3. Using the answers, the player then attempts to find the parrot behind the right curtain by picking 1, 2, or 3.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The main goal of this prototype is to test the questions and answers and how hard/easy it is to find the parrot.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The main feature of this game is comedy-driven responses to questions the user gets to ask.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is a family member polling other family member that he/she cannot see to determine who is the parrot.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
This game does not have a story past the setting.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is anyone who likes quick funny puzzle games. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This game takes roughly 30 seconds to play. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The best strategy is to pay close attention to the responses and avoid being mislead.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets except the curtains, parrot, mom, and dad sprites made by myself. Curtain image borrowed from curtainsdecors.net, mom image from campanula89.deviantart.com, parrot image from imgarcade.com, and dad image from vectortoons.com

<ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The closest game is the analog prototype. From that game I learned that the game should only be played by one person, rather than having a second person decide which curtain the parrot was behind.
