All assets except "Button" and "Sell" image, and music created by myself.

<ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Original game: https://tmcclel4.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/The%20Black%20Market/ . In this iteration the game now has a sell function, along with a count of how many items you have. In addition, you can now go bankrupt and lose the game entirely. Rather than money increasing by an acceleration rate, money is now gained by buying at a low price and selling at a higher price. The timing of the market fluctuations has been tuned as well and music has been added.
