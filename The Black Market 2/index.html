</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player may click on a button to increase the rate at which their money increases. The payout increase is determined by the counter below the button and players are limited in how many times they can click in a row by an inner timer. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The main mechanic being tested in this game is the timing of the payout amounts based on math functions. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>

The most effective strategy for this game is timing the button clicks to obtain the highest payout avaiable for that button. Generally the "Heart" button is the most lucrative.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets except "Button" image created by myself. "Button" image borrowed from http://www.wp-handyhints.com/freebies/40-free-buy-now-and-online-shopping-cart-buttons-for-e-commerce-websites/

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Original game: https://tmcclel4.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/The%20Black%20Market/ . In this iteration the game now has a sell function, along with a count of how many items you have. In addition, you can now go bankrupt and lose the game entirely. Rather than money increasing by an acceleration rate, money is now gained by buying at a low price and selling at a higher price. The timing of the market fluctuations has been tuned as well and music has been added.
