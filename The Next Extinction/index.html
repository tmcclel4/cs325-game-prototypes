<h2>The Next Extinction</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Your alien race has sent a remote controlled astroid to destroy earth and it is up to you to make it to the target!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Astroid heading for Earth
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game uses pointer input, random object generation, and the play style is dodging for a set amount of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should experience exhiliarating dodging of falling objects while maintaining control of an unwieldy astroid.  
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player may direct an astroid through space to avoid being struck by missiles. The core mechanic of this game is the astroid accelerating towards the pointer. When a missile collides with the astroid the game is over and the screen changes. If all missiles are avoided, a success screen plays at the end of the time limit.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Primarily movement. Collisions as well.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
You are trying to destroy Earth by piloting an astroid  instead of saving it!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
An alien race (unnamed at this time) is attempting to eliminate mankind by sending a remote controlled astroid to recreate the dinosaur extinction event. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The story in this game is the same as the setting. It does not have a more in-depth storyline in this version. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is any age group of people who would like to goof off for about 5-10 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The max time the game can run is 15 seconds. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The best strategy for the game is keeping the astroid moving in a tight circle to maintain stability and avoid slingshotting into the missles.
</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I created the missile and astroid sprites and background from scratch using microsoft paint.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game borrows the most elements from Invaders and Defender.
