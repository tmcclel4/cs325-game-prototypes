<h2>Roadblock</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Avoid crashing into the other cars and make as many passes through the intersection as possible
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Car Accident
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should experience fast paced racing towards a goal.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay for this game is based in the players having a throttle control and lane movement to avoid other cars. Each player has their own throttle button (A, C, N, or L) that increases acceleration up to a ceiling and then when let go decelerates back to a floor speed. Each player also has a left and right lane switch button that moves their car until let go or they reach the edge of the lane. When two cars collide they disappear in an explosion animation. Players get one point each time they successfully make it through the intersection. Only players that survive to the end of the time limit are eligable for winning. The remaining car(s) with the highest score is/are the winner(s).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Primarily movement, specifically adding lane movement and a points system based on location.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game features a semi-realistic throttle for the cars, nice explosions, and lane changing. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting of this game is a busy intersection with no traffic lights and an unreasonably high speed limit.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The story is that four crazy drivers are trying to make it through this intersection repeatedly without crashing. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is any age group of people who enjoy simple car games and explosions. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Play time is anywhere from 5 to 30 seconds. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will have to work together to time their passes if they all want to survive through this ordeal. Speed is key to making the most passes. 
</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets except the explosion animation were made by myself. Explosions spritesheet is from gamedev.net.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This is an interation on https://tmcclel4.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/Roadblock/. I learned from playtesting that prototype that the game could use a points system and move freedom of movement so it now has lane changing and a points system rather than being purely based in survival. Text on screen has also been better formatted.
