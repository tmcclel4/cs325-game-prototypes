<h2>Roadblock</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Avoid crashing into the other cars using your throttle!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Car Accident
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should experience cooperative gameplay that uses teamwork to accomplish a goal.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay for this game is based in the players having a throttle control that they use to speed up or slow down to avoid other cars. Each player has their own throttle button (A, C, N, or L) that increases acceleration up to a ceiling and then when let go decelerates back to a floor speed. When two cars collide they disappear in an explosion animation. If two players survive then they are listed on the screen as winners after the alloted time runs out. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Primarily movement, specifically getting the throttle control tuned well. This is also my first game utilizing animations.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game features a semi-realistic throttle for the cars, nice explosions, and team play. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting of this game is a busy intersection with no traffic lights and an unreasonably high speed limit.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The story is that four cars are trying to make their daily commute through this crazy intersection without crashing. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is any age group of people who enjoy simple car games and team strategy. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Play time is anywhere from 5 to 30 seconds. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will have to work together to time their passes if they all want to survive through this ordeal. 
</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets except the explosion animation were made by myself. Explosions spritesheet is from gamedev.net.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The closest other game is my analog prototype. I learned from that prototype that it would probably be better to have all four players work together rather than 2 on 2 because that version would only last about 10 seconds in the digital format and four players together sounded like more fun from my playtesting. I learned that genrally my throttle system was reasonable and that the overall concept could be made into a digital game without too many changes. The only significant chance aside from analog to digital is having four civilians rather than two fugitives escaping two police officers.
